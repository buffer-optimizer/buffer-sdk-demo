# Contributing to Buffer SDK Demo

> **⚠️ DISCLAIMER: This is a demonstration project created for job application purposes. Not affiliated with Buffer Inc.**

We welcome feedback and suggestions on this demonstration project! This contribution guide outlines how the project is structured and how one might approach similar SDK development.

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Setting Up Development Environment

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/buffer-sdk.git
cd buffer-sdk

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Build the package
npm run build

# Run linter
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix
```

## Code Style

We use ESLint and Prettier to maintain code quality and consistency.

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Provide proper type annotations
- Avoid `any` types when possible
- Use interfaces for object types
- Export types that might be useful to consumers

## Testing

We use Jest for testing. All new features should include tests.

### Test Structure

```typescript
describe('Feature Name', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup for each test
  });

  test('should do something specific', async () => {
    // Arrange
    const input = 'test data';
    
    // Act
    const result = await functionUnderTest(input);
    
    // Assert
    expect(result).toBe('expected output');
  });
});
```

### Test Guidelines

- Write descriptive test names
- Test both success and error cases
- Use mocks appropriately
- Aim for high test coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
2. **Make your changes**: Follow the coding standards
3. **Add tests**: Ensure your changes are tested
4. **Update documentation**: If you change APIs or add features
5. **Run the full test suite**: `npm test`
6. **Commit your changes**: Use descriptive commit messages
7. **Push to your fork**: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
8. **Create a Pull Request**: Use the PR template

### Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that don't affect code meaning
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Examples:
```
feat(analytics): add support for custom date ranges
fix(client): handle network timeouts properly
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(posts): add tests for post creation edge cases
```

## Bug Reports

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/bufferapp/buffer-sdk/issues/new).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
    - Be specific!
    - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

### Bug Report Template

```markdown
**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Code Sample**
```typescript
// Your code sample here
```

**Environment:**
- OS: [e.g. macOS 12.0]
- Node.js version: [e.g. 18.0.0]
- SDK version: [e.g. 1.0.0]

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.
```

## Feature Requests

We welcome feature requests! Please provide:

- **Clear description** of the feature
- **Use case** - why is this feature needed?
- **Proposed API** - how should it work?
- **Examples** - show how it would be used

## Documentation

Good documentation is crucial for adoption. When contributing:

- Update README.md if you change public APIs
- Add JSDoc comments to public methods
- Include code examples in documentation
- Update TypeScript definitions
- Consider adding to the examples/ directory

### Documentation Style

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples
- Show both success and error cases
- Link to related documentation

## Release Process

Releases are handled by maintainers:

1. Update version in package.json
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Create a release tag
4. Publish to npm
5. Update GitHub release notes

## Community Guidelines

### Code of Conduct

Be respectful and inclusive. We want to foster a welcoming environment for everyone.

### Getting Help

- Check existing issues and documentation first
- Use GitHub Discussions for questions
- Be specific about your problem
- Include relevant code samples and error messages

## Development Tips

### Working with Mock Data

The SDK includes a mock mode for development:

```typescript
const client = await createBufferClient({
  bufferSDK: {
    sdkMockMode: true, // Enable mock mode
    // ... other config
  },
});
```

### Testing API Changes

When making changes to the API:

1. Test with mock mode first
2. Test with real API (if you have access)
3. Verify error handling
4. Check rate limiting behavior

### Adding New Platforms

To add support for a new social media platform:

1. Add platform to `SocialPlatform` type
2. Update mock data generators
3. Add platform-specific metrics
4. Update documentation
5. Add tests

### Performance Considerations

- Use appropriate HTTP timeouts
- Implement proper retry logic
- Handle rate limiting gracefully
- Cache responses when appropriate
- Avoid unnecessary API calls
